# The C Programming Language
A Repository on my tasks at <strong>ALX AFRICA</strong> on the basics of interacting with computers at low level with different computer language, specifically the C Programming language.

The C Programming Language is an imperative, general purpose computer programming language, supporting structured, lexical variable scope and recursion, with a static type system. It was created by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and Influential. The language which has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks and application software. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language construct that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal instructions. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
